CMS(Content Management System)->
	-> provides most of the infrastructure
	-> reusability
	-> Create and publish content
	-> No technical expertise needed for content

Types of CMS
	-> Traditional CMS
		-> Coupled CMS(logic is binded to redering framewok)
		-> Decoupled CMS(logic is not binded to redering framewok)
	-> Headless CMS(CMS can deliever only content)
	-> Hybrid CMS  (provides headless as well as traditional functionality)

Note: AEM is Hybrid, decoupled CMS

CMS contents
	-> Content Management System
	-> Content delivery/ Application
	-> Front end/ presentation

CMS provides
	-> CMS
	-> Digital Assest management
	-> User/Permissions management
	-> Headless feature
	-> Built and run websites

AEM
	-> Comprehensive content management solution for building websites, mobile apps, and forms.
	-> make it easy to mange marketing content and assets.
	-> AEM is a part of Adobe Experience cloud.

Types of AEM
	-> On premises/ Stand alone
	-> Cloud based
		-> instances are installed over cloud.
		-> AEM is a Cloud Service
			-> Standalone JAR/local
				-> works same as standalone jar
			-> Sandbox

AEM provides
	-> Sites
	-> Assets
	-> Forms- Add on package

AEM features
	-> CMS
	-> Digital Assest management
	-> User/Permissions management
	-> Forms Management
	-> Headless feature
	-> Built and run websites
	-> Frontend tech/ Other FE framework Integrations
	-> Servlet/OSGI container

AEM Instances
	-> it is a running AEM software
	-> Environments/RunModes
	-> Dispatcher(Tiny modules such as Apache)

Type of AEM Instances
	-> Author 
		-> Type of Instance when we create content
	-> Publish/publisher
		-> Type of Instance which serve content to end user

Environments/RunModes( change behaviour of environments/execution based on type of instance using this Runmodes )
	-> dev
	-> qa
	-> stage
	-> prod
	-> Any Name

How to create Content in AEM?
	-> Author: Where we create content.

	-> Publish: All end user access this instance.

	-> replication: Create content and move that content author to publish called as replicate/publish.


AEM environments:

Author(we create author content)
	-> Publish1(this instances serve content)
	-> Publish2

	-> webserver: 
		-> No way to distribute load only with publish instance. So, we add web server in between end users and publish instance.
		-> Adobe provide tiny module called Dispatcher, with the help of it publish instance can communicate with web server.
		-> there is load balancer to handle load.
		-> web server can itself worked as Load balancer.
   

AEM Sections and Consoles:

	-> Start console:
	-> System console:
		-> Go to "http://localhost:4502/system/console/bundles"
		-> All project related bundles installed here.
	-> Dev console:
	-> Package Manager

CRXDE
	-> It is a Tiny IDE
	-> Go to "http://localhost:4502/crx/de/index.jsp"
	-> check data at repsosiotry level 
	-> this IDE/console showyou how to stored content? what is stored? Where it is stored?

	Project Directory structure:
	1. /content
	The /content folder contains the actual website content. This is where authors and developers manage pages, assets, and structured content.
	Key Features:
		Represents the content hierarchy of the website.
		Organized by sites or locales.
		Typical Structure:
		/content/<project-name>: Stores the main site content.
		Example:
			/content/my-site
    				/en        (English version of the site)
    				/fr        (French version of the site)
    				/de        (German version of the site)
		Content here is created using page templates and components defined in /apps.
		Common Node Types:
		cq:Page: Represents a webpage.
		cq:PageContent: Contains the content and properties of a page.

	2. /apps
	The /apps folder is where custom application code resides. This is the main folder for developers to store custom components, templates, and configurations.
	Key Features:
		Stores reusable resources for the project.
		Serves as the codebase for all development.
	Typical Structure:
		/apps/<project-name>:
	components: Custom components (e.g., header, footer, carousel).

How to deploy website from one instance to another instance?

package manager
	-> Go to "http://localhost:4502/crx/packmgr/index.jsp"
	-> Create package, give package name, version. Click OK.
	-> Edit -> filters -> content>we-retail -> SAVE -> BUILD -> Download
	-> Upload package by selecting path.
===========================================================
AEM Sites
	-> AEM built on JCR
	-> AEM uses JCR(Java Content Repository) to save data.
	-> Nowdays we can use MongoDB.

==========

Page Operations & properties
	-> Go to sites -> select lang. -> select we-retail -> create -> select page -> Choose template
		title : name of site
		name : url (bedfault take title in lower-case)

	-> editor.html -> open in edit mode

Note : Everything is component in AEM

	layout : Edit->layout mode

	Toggle side pannel:
		contains assets, Can add images

	Menu :
		Rollout page
		Start workflow
		Page lock(access/deny page operation)
		Publish 
		Edit template
		View in publish mode (http://localhost:4502/content/we-retail/language-masters/en/test-page.html?wcamode=disabled)
		
	Test page :
	properties -> whatever u add related to this page only.(its local)	
		   -> Page prop. is always store in JCR format.

AEM Editable Template
	-> Go to -> Tools -> General -> Templates -> Create

Note -> Before creating template developers has been created all dependencies.
	-> All structures created under conf folder(CRX/DE)

	-> After creation of template go to home page.
	-> go to sites-> page -> select created template -> create page
	-> Here you not abled to see any drag/drop box
	-> you need to enable those component in test template
	-> Go to testTemplate -> unlock first -> select component -> select policy icon -> select we-retail default policy
	-> Can create custom policy by changing name to Custom Policy only -> remove er-retail commerce and we-retail policy
	 from them and save them. You can able to see only two components in Test page
	
	## Define page properties already reloaded when it is visited
	-> go to Test template -> inital page properties


Structure(Test Template):
	-> Structure : can add component to structure as well.
		-> what ever u add in structure its dynamically binded with all pages.(if u make changes in template it will reflect in all pages)
		-> You can't added or delete in pages only in template
	-> Initial Content : 
		-> can able to add content to template -> it will reflect into a new page as well when we create.
		Note: image component is not avail in old page 
		while creating page, whatever component u created is avai for those page, but is not avai for old pages 
		there is static relation between those page
	-> layout


AEM Templates
How to open templates?
	-> go to tools
	-> select your template
	-> open edit mode. and select structure.


==========
18/12/2024
==========
AEM Components:
	-> using AEM components, reuse piece of code along with u have UI , we can add custom content, can do styling

	-> Building block of components creation and content rendering
	-> can save user content:
		-> we have dialog 
	-> access content and save content in JCR
		-> sling model (can access that content using sling model)
	-> can Add styling
		-> clientlibs (can write folder inside that htmls, css, js, font style and club together using clientlib)
	-> can Render content
		-> Slightly/HTL (lang. specific to AEM, supported by Sling, Apache, it is a simple HTML having a placeholder)
	
	-> AEM component cycle:
		When drag n drop component in page, node is created inside JCR(having content in key-value pair)
				||
		Dialog - Authoring Component
		(Open Dialog)
			 	||
		Save content in Repository
		(Save content in node in that prop. called it as Authoring.)
			FIRST PHASE AUTHORING OVER
				||
		Sling Model - Access content for repository
		(as soon as page reload, sling model kicks in. This backend gets all values from JCR , it provide to frontend.)
				||
		Page Load - Load clientlibs(CSS/JS)
		(Client library will also load as soon as page reload.)
				||
		Slightly load content from Sling Model in Component.
		(Slighly has some placeholders. So, whatever content Slightly has will inject that data inside palceholder avaai. in HTL classes.)
			SECOND PHASE RENDERING OVER
	
	Another components:
		-> Foundation Components
		-> Core Components (This are starting point)

AEM Content level policies
	-> Content policies are template-level configuration for the templates and its components.
	-> The content policies define the design properties of a component.

	1) page-level policies
	2) component-level policies -> has specific section as per component.

Lock and Unlock structures
	-> strc is lock all components is gone. u can't able to edit, view.
	-> if u want to access unlock

==========

==========

Note : Opening of classic UI (" http://localhost:4502/miscadmin#/ ")
	Another way: Operations-> configuration -> classic UI

ClientLibs 
	-> clientlib generated by plugins
	-> can html, css, js files keep inside in it.
	-> project folder creation ->
		-> right click on apps->we-retail->clientlibs-> create Node having type:cq(clientLibraryfolder)->save
		-> inside at bottom of properties add categories along with value-> save
	-> create folder css and js inside aem-demo
		create a css/js files and add into a css.txt/ js.txt to load that files -> save
		eg.	#base=css   (this is base folder inside this i want to load this it is optional)
			color.css
			button.css
	-> Go to templates -> page policy -> name policy -> select client lib add that u have created

AEM Component Styles
	-> can define classes in your component policy and page policy. 
	-> this classes can be choose content author based on those selection diff. style can be applied. (All CSS, Js written)client library
	-> Style system include
		-> ClientLibs(CSS, Js)
		-> Style name to Content/page policy
		-> Choose style while authoring
			-> Template Author
			-> content Author (This are group used to mention two diff. users)
 
AEM page versioning
	-> can create snapshot/backup of page at a specific point of time. can have multiple backup 
	Operations->
		-> create a version of a page.
		-> restore a page to a previous version.
		-> compare curent version of page with a previous version with differences in the text and images highlighted.

	backup of page-> 
		open site -> select template-> lang-> site page -> edit -> version -> create -> give name and labe

Replication agents
	->connection between in two or more isntances we need replication agents.
	-> 
	-> replication agents includes:
		agents on publish
			-> dispatcher flush: triggered on modification and flush req to dispatcher
			-> reverse replication: Agents that stores reverse replicated content in the outbox.
			-> Dispatcher resourceOnly Flush: agent that is triggered on modification and sends flush requests to the dispatcher.
		agents on author
			-> Default Agent (publish): Agent that replicates to the default publish instance.
			-> Dispatcher Flush (flush): Agent that sends flush requests to the dispatcher.
			-> Reverse replication agent: Create on publish and create on author.
			and Many more...
		activate tree
			-> u can activate entire site in one go.
			-> select parent page -> deselect only modified and ignore deactivated
			-> it will activate whatever under we-retail
	-> Go to tools, deployment, replication
	-> reverse application agents.

	Steps:
		-> Go to classic UI (" http://localhost:4502/miscadmin#/ ")->Replication-> Agents on author -> New -> Replication agent -> name it -> create
		-> Change settings of Replication agent:
			-> Enabled tick
			-> Serialization typr: default
			-> retry delay :6000
			Transport:
			-> uri: "http://localhost:4502/bin/receive?sling:authRequestLogin=1"
			-> user and pwd
			-> OK (it is green means enabled)


Aem workflow
	-> AEM workflow allows you to automate series of steps that are performed on (one or more ) pages and/or assets.

	-> Go to tools-> workflow
	-> create -> new workflow -> add steps from left pannel (eg. create version) remove unused steps. -> Sync

PoC (Proof Of Concept) in AEM

feasibility -> posibility of idea
viable -> workable
Applicable -> relevant to user scenarios
practical -> resources 

1-> Prove the need
2-> Problem<->solution mapping
3-> Prototype creation
4-> Create MVN(Minimum Viable Product)
5-> Learning And Roadmap

What is PoC Deliverables?
 PoC deliverables in AEM are the specific outcomes or results you produce to demonstrate that your proposed solution works. 

Example:
---------------------------------------------------------------
User Requirements:
---------------------------------------------------------------
1. Dynamic Article Repository:
Create a section to manage articles dynamically, including adding, editing, deleting, and archiving articles.
Each article should have metadata like title, description, author, publication date, tags, and status (Published/Unpublished/Archived).

2. Personalized Content Delivery:
Deliver personalized articles to users based on their preferences and browsing behavior.
Implement category-based filtering (e.g., Sports, Technology, Health, etc.).
Use geolocation to further refine content delivery.

3. Admin Approval Workflow:
Introduce an approval mechanism where changes to articles are not published directly.
Admin reviews and approves/rejects the content changes.
Notify the author of the decision.

4. Content Versioning:
Maintain versions of each article to track changes over time.
Allow admins to roll back to previous versions when necessary.

5. Analytics Dashboard:
Provide a dashboard displaying user engagement metrics (e.g., most viewed articles, categories with the highest readership).
Store analytics data in a database for retrieval and display.

6. Responsive Design:
Ensure the article display components are fully responsive and compatible with both desktop and mobile devices.

---------------------------------------------------------------
PoC Deliverables:
---------------------------------------------------------------

Backend:
Sling Models for dynamic article fetching.
Servlets for handling personalization logic and geolocation-based filtering.
JCR (Java Content Repository) implementation for storing articles and metadata.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Frontend:
HTL (Sightly) templates and components for article listing and detail view.
Clientlibs for CSS and JavaScript to handle responsive design and interactivity.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Workflow:
Custom AEM workflow for article approval and notification.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Versioning:
Enable OOTB (Out-of-the-Box) versioning for articles in AEM.
Provide a UI to list and restore previous versions.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Analytics Integration:
Integrate Google Analytics or an AEM-compatible analytics tool.
Provide basic charts on the analytics dashboard using a Java-based library like Apache POI or external chart libraries.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Implementation Plan:
1. Define Article Structure:
Create a content structure under /content/poc/articles.
Include metadata fields like category, status, and geolocation preferences.

2.Create Dynamic Components:
Develop an "Article List" component to display articles dynamically.
Develop an "Article Detail" component to display full content.

3. Personalization:
Use ContextHub or a custom logic in servlets to fetch user preferences and geolocation.
Filter articles based on the user data.

4. Custom Workflow:
Define a workflow with steps for author submission, admin review, and notification.

5. Testing:
Test the POC in both author and publish environments.
Validate the workflow, personalization logic, and versioning.

---------------------------------------------------------------
PoC: Dynamic Article Management with Personalization in AEM**
---------------------------------------------------------------
### **1. Project Structure**

#### **Content Repository Structure**:
- `/content/poc/articles` (Root for articles)
  - `article1` (An example article node)
    - `title` (String)
    - `description` (String)
    - `author` (String)
    - `publicationDate` (Date)
    - `tags` (String[])
    - `status` (String: Published/Unpublished/Archived)

#### **Component Structure**:
- `/apps/poc/components`
  - `articleList` (List of articles component)
  - `articleDetail` (Individual article component)
  - `analyticsDashboard` (Analytics dashboard component)

---------------------------------------------------------------

### **2. Backend Implementation**

#### **A. Sling Model for Article Retrieval**:
```java
package com.poc.core.models;

import com.adobe.cq.sightly.WCMUsePojo;
import com.day.cq.wcm.api.Page;
import com.day.cq.wcm.api.PageManager;
import org.apache.sling.api.resource.Resource;
import org.apache.sling.models.annotations.Model;
import org.apache.sling.models.annotations.injectorspecific.Self;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

@Model(adaptables = Resource.class)
public class ArticleListModel {

    @Inject
    private Resource currentResource;

    public List<Article> getArticles() {
        List<Article> articles = new ArrayList<>();
        Resource articlesResource = currentResource.getChild("articles");
        if (articlesResource != null) {
            for (Resource articleResource : articlesResource.getChildren()) {
                Article article = new Article(
                    articleResource.getValueMap().get("title", String.class),
                    articleResource.getValueMap().get("description", String.class),
                    articleResource.getValueMap().get("author", String.class),
                    articleResource.getValueMap().get("publicationDate", String.class),
                    articleResource.getValueMap().get("status", String.class)
                );
                articles.add(article);
            }
        }
        return articles;
    }
}

class Article {
    private String title;
    private String description;
    private String author;
    private String publicationDate;
    private String status;

    public Article(String title, String description, String author, String publicationDate, String status) {
        this.title = title;
        this.description = description;
        this.author = author;
        this.publicationDate = publicationDate;
        this.status = status;
    }

    // Getters and setters omitted for brevity
}
```

#### **B. Servlet for Personalization**:
```java
package com.poc.core.servlets;

import com.google.gson.Gson;
import org.apache.sling.api.SlingHttpServletRequest;
import org.apache.sling.api.SlingHttpServletResponse;
import org.apache.sling.api.servlets.HttpConstants;
import org.apache.sling.api.servlets.SlingAllMethodsServlet;
import org.osgi.service.component.annotations.Component;

import javax.servlet.Servlet;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

@Component(service = Servlet.class,
           property = {
               "sling.servlet.methods=" + HttpConstants.METHOD_GET,
               "sling.servlet.paths=" + "/bin/poc/personalizedArticles"
           })
public class PersonalizedArticleServlet extends SlingAllMethodsServlet {

    @Override
    protected void doGet(SlingHttpServletRequest request, SlingHttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
        Map<String, String> articles = new HashMap<>();
        // Mocking personalized logic based on user preferences
        articles.put("Sports", "Latest Football Updates");
        articles.put("Technology", "Top Gadgets of 2024");
        articles.put("Health", "10 Tips for Healthy Living");

        response.setContentType("application/json");
        response.getWriter().write(new Gson().toJson(articles));
    }
}
```

---------------------------------------------------------------

### **3. Frontend Implementation**

#### **A. HTL Template for Article List**:
```html
<div class="article-list">
    <h2>Articles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li data-sly-repeat.article="${model.articles}">
            <h3>${article.title}</h3>
            <p>${article.description}</p>
            <span>Author: ${article.author}</span>
            <span>Date: ${article.publicationDate}</span>
            <span>Status: ${article.status}</span>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

#### **B. HTL Template for Article Detail**:
```html
<div class="article-detail">
    <h1>${model.title}</h1>
    <p>${model.description}</p>
    <span>Written by: ${model.author} on ${model.publicationDate}</span>
</div>
```

#### **C. Analytics Dashboard (Mock)**:
```html
<div class="analytics-dashboard">
    <h2>Analytics</h2>
    <p>Most Viewed: Sports Articles</p>
    <p>Highest Readership: Technology</p>
    <p>Last Week Stats: 5000 Visitors</p>
</div>
```

---------------------------------------------------------------

### **4. Workflow Configuration**

#### **AEM Workflow Steps**:
1. User Submits Article Changes.
2. Admin Review Step:
   - Approve: Publish the article.
   - Reject: Notify the author.

#### **Custom Workflow Implementation**:
- Create a new workflow model in AEM Workflow Editor.
- Add "Participant Step" for Admin approval.
- Configure notifications to alert authors on approval/rejection.

---------------------------------------------------------------

### **5. Testing**

#### **Steps to Test**:
1. Add sample articles under `/content/poc/articles`.
2. Access the article list component and verify data retrieval.
3. Simulate a user with specific preferences (e.g., sports) and test personalized article delivery.
4. Test the workflow by editing an article and submitting it for approval.
5. Validate analytics mock display.

AEM maven project 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=================================================================================================================
Why maven archetype in AEM?
	->maven template that creates a minimal, best practices based AEM project as a starting point for website.


projec types->
	AEMaaCS - Cloud 
		-> Standard/Web
		-> SPA
			-> React
			-> Angular
	AEM - AMS/Standalone 
		-> Standard/Web
		-> SPA
			-> React
			-> Angular

Possble issues:
	Open CMS as administrator - Windows OS (might get error)
	settings.xml in .m2 directory with adobe-public profile.
	check if firewall is blocking dependency download request.

AEM maven project structure:
Pom sections:
<project>
	<modules>.......</modules>
	<properties>........</properties>
	<build>
		<plugins>        </plugins>
		<pluginManagement>                  </pluginManagement>
	</build>
	<profiles>   --Used to customize build behaviour--  </profiles>
	<dependencyManagement>       </dependencyManagement>
</project>

Maven plugins
	Plugings are used to create content package.
	Deploy bundles in AEM.
	Build plugins --> AEm archetype only adds build plugins.
	Reporting plugins


=========== Maven script to create Project ============
Check MVN version in cmd: mvn --version

Note:
	-B use to create cmd in batch
	-D use to this are system properties.
	 n no
Steps:
Open cmd as administrator otherwise u will get build failure. And then cd path of project folder.
then execute below cmds.

mvn -B org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-archetype-plugin:3.2.1:generate ^
 -D archetypeGroupId=com.adobe.aem ^
 -D archetypeArtifactId=aem-project-archetype ^
 -D archetypeVersion=40 ^
 -D appTitle="Geeks Demo" ^
 -D appId="geeksdemo" ^
 -D groupId="com.geeks.demo" ^
 -D aemVersion=6.5.5 ^

Breadcrumb Component
The Core Component Breadcrumb Component is a navigation component that builds a breadcrumb of links based on the page’s location in the content hierarchy.

Usage
The Breadcrumb Component displays the position of the current page within the site hierarchy, allowing page visitors to navigate the page hierarchy from their current location. 
This is often integrated into page headers or footers.

Available options, such as the default navigation level and the ability to show the current page or hidden pages, can be defined by the template author in the design dialog. 
The content editor can then choose if hidden pages should be shown or not and the actual navigation level for the component in the edit dialog.

Note: BreadCrumb and Title components are siblings.
